        <p>Firstly, don't try to learn too much, it's far more productive to learn a bit a day and keep at it. Rome wasn't built in a day. The foundation of learning <em>anything</em> new is crucial. You shouldn't want to skip things, just to get to the good parts. </p>

        <p>Secondly, learn your scales, don't try and remember them all, just learn the three basic ones; C Major, G Major and F Major. The G and F Major only have one note different than the original C Major key. They also help remembering chords too, like if you wanted to play a E Minor chord, all you would have to do is play the 3rd, 5th and 7th of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_major" target="_blank">C Major scale</a>.</p>

        <p>Also, <strong>remember to have fun</strong>, don't be too worried about making mistakes; mistakes build a persons character, you might find some mistakes even good. </p>
